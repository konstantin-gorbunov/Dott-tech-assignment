Feedback from review:
- lack of documentation, comments, some very large methods with 90+ lines of code, force unwraps, potential runtime crashes (accessing array indexes without safety checks)
- code is tied to flickr everywhere, even variable names.
- chosen architecture MVC is very basic and even for this project ended up causing responsibility leaks (VC downloading images)
- image downloading is done without any network layer
- small test coverage
